inotify:
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-inotify/

we divided the programme into several function:
Taijie Yang did sig_handler, use sigalarm to print time regularly and inotify
Yuqi Zhang did struct type,readdir, print the initial file and solve the problem when a file does not exist at the beginning,then create it and delete it, nothing will happen.
Then we discuss the rest parts.

We run the programme on the lab machine.
